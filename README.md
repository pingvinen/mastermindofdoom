MasterMind of Doom
==================

This is just for fun :)

Implementation of [MasterMind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) where the computer acts as the code maker and a human plays against several computer code breakers (each using a different algorithm).

In the longer run it could be fun to enable multiple humans to play against each other aswell.
